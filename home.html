        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
            A various assortment of things that will <br>
            hopefully be a speck of sunshine when you need it. <br>
            From stories of kind strangers helping those in <br>
            need to pictures of silly animals.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            There are so many news and media <br>
            outlets constantly showing us all of the<br>
            bad things and that can sometimes make a<br>
            bad day worse. Reading do-good stories and<br>
            looking at cute or funny pictures can help<br>
            boost your mood in just a few minutes.<br>
            Maybe it can inspire you to spread a little kindness.
        </p>

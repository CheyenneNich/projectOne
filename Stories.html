                        We've heard for years, if not decades, that we are killing the trees. While there are some large companies and organizations that are doing their part, it is nothing quite like
                        23 year old Antoine Moses.The young Quebecer broke world records when he planted 23, 060 trees in 24 hours. The previous record was 15, 170 set in 2001.
                        Moses is a young althele, triaining for an upcoming Ironman race, and now a generational hero.<br>

                    <p>
                        A mural painted at a "daunting and dangerous" intersection has helped reduce the average speed by half. 65% of people that live
                        in the community now say they feel very safe which is up from the 25% before the mural was painted. Bloomberg Philanthropies
                        conducted the research. The organization also has an Asphalt Art Inititive that is transforming public spaces into art. With the right approach
                        they could de-stigmatize street art. <br>

                    <p>
                        There is a jupiter-sized exoplanet about 580 light-years away and astronomers said it has the average density of a marshmallow.
                        The planet, TOI-3757 b, dense enough it would float in a bathtub. If there were bathtubs in space, of course. <br>

                        Thanks to various POC social media influencers black women are finally being recognized for popularizing nail art. Originating in 1950, nail art became
                        wildly popular because of famous black women throught history. Model Donyale Luna on the cover of a magazine in 1966, singers Diana Ross and Donna Summer in the 1970s,
                        La Toya Jackson and Flo Jo in the 80's and 90's. The current new wave nail art was solidified by Missy Elliott and Lil Kim.<br>

                    <p>
                        The two biggest marathons in the world announced they will be adding a third gender option, non-binary, to their 2023 registration. They also said athketes that enter as non-binary
                        would not be able to win prize money just yet but lgbtq+ spokespeople are working with the sport officals to make that happen. They don't have enough data to determine a standard
                        time for non-binary persons as of yet. Inclusity is sports is starting to become the standard practice.<br>
